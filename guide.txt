# 2) Introduction
Magi-Nation is a well-received Gameboy Color game that had the flaw of being released late in the console's life cycle and so was not as well known as other big titles. It was developed in Seattle by a small team of developers that had many sleepless nights to meet deadlines to release the game on time. The current achievement set includes almost all of the hidden content in the game, including some secrets discovered as late as 2024!

This guide goes through all the achievements that are not automatically unlocked in a normal playthrough, or that are not obvious from the achievement description. Generally, the achievements are in chronological order, and if you try and obtain the achievements when they are next on the list, you should not miss it. Do not read the next two sections if you want to avoid spoilers!

# 3) Warnings
* If you would like to encounter Ormagon, follow an Ormagon guide from early on. Remember not to cure Orwin until after reaching the end of the quest.
* If you do not return Ashgar's key before defeating the Cald shadow geyser, you will no longer be able to Forge Cald dream creatures and nobody in the Cald will want to talk to you.
* There are two different endings based on whether Orwin was healed. You can wait to heal Orwin until the end of the game, allowing you to quickly unlock both endings without having to restart the entire game.

_Obtain a Great Furok by almost escaping the Tavel Gorge caves._

The Tavel Gorge caves have 3 different maps associated with them. After taking the crystal, you must run all the way back to the very first map before falling down into a chasm. After that, Pruitt will automatically give you a great Furok (level 5), as opposed to a normal or good Furok (level 2 or 3).

_Beat Avoid the Agovos in under 7.4 seconds._

The minigame unlocks in Vash Naroom after beating the first Shadow Geyser. Taking the left path is faster than the right as the distance is shorter.

_Score at least 60 points in Scrub the Brub._

The brubs spawn from left to right, each column having a 50% chance of spawning a brub. When any brub is squished, the spawner immediately restarts from the left side, potentially skipping the middle or right column. Therefore, the best strategy is to stand in the middle and focus on the left and middle column.

_Defeat Morag at your first encounter._

Defeat Morag in the Underneath. Morag starts with 39,935 energy, which is enough to summon 199 Borgors. There are two strategies to defeat him. Without defeating his Koil, use Thrust from a Tusk Bwisp to whittle down his energy to zero before defeating the Koil. Alternatively, a maxed-out team of Ormagons using Consume can defeat all the Borgors, assuming you don't run into bad RNG.
